# Interview Preparation Book 

This book is a collection of notes that I have made while preparing for interviews. I have tried to cover as many topics as possible. I have also included some of the questions that I have been asked in interviews.

I have tried to keep the notes as concise as possible. I have also included links to the resources that I have used to prepare for interviews.

I hope that this book will help you in your preparation for interviews.
